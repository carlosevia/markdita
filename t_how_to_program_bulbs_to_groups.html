<div class="body"><p class="p">You can program one or more light bulbs to a lighting group to operate that group with your remote control.</p>
<ol class="ol"><li class="li"><p class="p">Make sure your remote control is in range of the light bulbs you are adding.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">If a network light bulb is new, you must install it by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol class="ol" type="a"><li class="li">Make sure power to the fixture where you are installing the light bulb is turned <strong class="ph b">OFF</strong>.</li>
<li class="li">Remove any existing light bulb from the light fixture.</li>
<li class="li">Install the network light bulb into the light fixture as you would any standard light bulb.</li>
<li class="li">Turn power to the light fixture on. The light bulb begins to brighten and dim while finding the remote controlâ€™s network.</li>
<li class="li">Repeat this step for each new network light bulb.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Turn power on to the fixtures containing network light bulbs you want added to the light group.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Turn power off to the fixtures containing light bulbs you do not want added to the light group.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">On the remote control, press and hold the desired lighting group button for 5 seconds. </p>
<p class="p">The button indicator for the selected lighting group flashes green while the light bulb(s) are added to the group. If the indicator flashes red, the lighting group was not activated and you must try again. Light flashes red for 3 seconds if programming fails.</p>
</li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">Leave the light fixture switches <strong class="ph b">ON</strong> so that power is available when using your remote control to turn the light bulbs on and off. Also remember to turn on any excluded fixtures that you turned off.</p>
</li>
