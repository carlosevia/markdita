# Turning On/Off or Dimming a Lights {#how_to_turn_on_off_dim_lights .task}

You can turn on, turn off, or dim a lighting group by pressing the group number button and then pressing the power button or the dimmer control.

Before you can operate a lighting group you must [program the network light bulbs](how_to_program_bulbs_to_groups.md#) you want included in that lighting group.

To turn on, turn off, or dim lights:

1.  Select the lighting group\(s\) you want to operate:

    CAUTION:

    When selecting a lighting group, do not press and hold the lighting group button for longer than 4 seconds. Doing so activates light bulb programming for the selected lighting group.

    |For this situation...|Perform this task...|
    |---------------------|--------------------|
    |**Operate the lighting group that was last controlled**|Do not press a lighting group button \(pressing the button is optional\). The most recent lighting group remains current on the remote control.|
    |**Operate one lighting group**|Press the number button for the lighting group you want to operate.|
    |**Operate all lighting groups**|Press the **1-4** button.|
    |**Turn on/off all network lights regardless of programming**|Do not press a lighting group button \(pressing any lighting group button is irrelevant\). Skip to the next step.|

    **Note:** You have 5 seconds to operate the selected lighting group once it is activated. After 5 seconds of inactivity \(when the green indicator light turns of\), you must start over.

    The button indicator for the selected lighting group turns green when the group is activated. If the indicator turns red, the lighting group was not activated and you must try again.

2.  Turn on, turn off, or dim the lighting group:

    |For this lighting result...|Perform this task...|
    |---------------------------|--------------------|
    |**Turn on/off**|Press the power button. The selected lighting group turns on if it is currently off and turns off if it is currently on.|
    |**Turn on/off all network lights regardless of programming**|Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds. All network lights \(even if not programmed\) initially turn on. Repeat this task to turn them all off.|
    |**Dim up \(brighten\)**|Press upward on the dimmer control. You do not have to press the power button first.|
    |**Dim down \(soften\)**|Press downward on the dimmer control. You do not have to press the power button first.|

    The power button indicator turns green if the signal is successfully sent. If the indicator turns red, the signal was not sent and you must start over.


The light bulbs in the selected lighting group turn on, turn off, or dim depending on your selection.
