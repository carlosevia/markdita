# Basic Concepts of Network Lighting {.concept}

You can network LED light bulbs together to operate wirelessly from a remote control.

Network light bulbs work with your light fixtures the same way as standard light bulbs. They are different, however, in a couple of ways:

-   The lighting element in the light bulb uses energy-efficient LED technology.
-   The light bulb includes wireless technology that allows the light bulb to connect to a network and be managed remotely.

Because the light bulbs can be connected to a network, you have greater flexibility in how you use them.

## Examples {.example}

-   You can program your lighting network so that when you press a button upon arriving home, an entryway and a hallway light turn on.
-   When you go to bed, your remote control can turn off all lights on the network.

-   [lowpower]. Network lighting operates at a low level of networking power but can successfully connect at long distances because they can send information from light bulb to light bulb.
-   [maximum]. Testing shows you should network no more than 250 light bulbs to maintain reliable performance.
