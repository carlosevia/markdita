# MarkDITA example

This is a quick implementation of the [Markdown DITA](https://github.com/jelovirt/dita-ot-markdown) plug-in developed by Jarno Elovirta.

The plug-in reflects some basic DITA to Markdown mapping that aligns with work from the Lightweight DITA OASIS subcommittee.

A mobile-friendly transform of this site can be seen on [GitHub Pages](http://carlosevia.github.io/markdita/)
